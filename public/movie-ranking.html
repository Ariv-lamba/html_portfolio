	<h1>The Best Anime According to Angela </h1>
	<h2>My top 4 Animes of all the time.</h2>
	<hr>
	<h3>Naruto</h3>
	<p>Naruto is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Masashi Kishimoto. It tells the story of Naruto Uzumaki, a young ninja who seeks recognition from his peers and dreams of becoming the Hokage, the leader of his village.</p>

	<h3> Demon Slayer  </h3>
	<p>In this fictional world set in early 20th century Taishō-era Japan, man-eating demons roam the land each night. 13-year-old Tanjiro Kamado's world is turned upside down when he returns home one morning to find his entire family murdered save for his sister Nezuko—who has turned into a demon.</p>

	<h3> Haikyu </h3>
	<p>Ultimately, the message that is consistently conveyed throughout the series of Haikyuu!! is that of an inspiring one. Despite all of the problems that each of the characters find themselves facing throughout the course of the narrative, they always inspire themselves to overcome their obstacles.</p>

	<h3>The Wizard King</h3>
	<p>Hard Work Bridges the Gap. Natural talent and abilities are wonderful gifts, but the series showcases that they aren't the end-all-be-all. Asta's tenacity and Yuno's dedication underscore the idea that grit, perseverance, and consistent effort can sometimes even the playing field.</p>
